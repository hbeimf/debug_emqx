"""This configuration parameter is designated for the license key and supports below input formats:

- Direct Key: Enter the secret key directly as a string value.
- File Path: Specify the path to a file that contains the secret key. Ensure the path starts with <code>file://</code>.
- "default": Use string value <code>"default"</code> to apply the default trial license.

Note: An invalid license key or an incorrect file path may prevent EMQX from starting successfully.
If a file path is used, EMQX attempts to reload the license key from the file every 2 minutes.
Any failure in reloading the license file will be recorded as an error level log message,
and EMQX continues to apply the license loaded previously."""
