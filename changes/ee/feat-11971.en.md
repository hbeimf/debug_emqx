Made `/api/v5/load_rebalance/availability_check` public, i.e. not requiring authentication. This simplifies load balancer setup.

Made rebalance/evacuation more graceful during the wait health check phase. The connections to nodes marked for eviction are now not prohibited during this phase.
During this phase it is unknown whether these nodes are all marked unhealthy by the load balancer, so prohibiting connections to them may cause multiple unssuccessful attempts to reconnect.
