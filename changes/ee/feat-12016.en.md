Enhanced license key management.

EMQX can now load the license key from a specified file. This is enabled by setting the `license.key` configuration to a file path, which should be prefixed with `"file://"`.
Also added the ability to revert to the default trial license by setting `license.key = default`. This option simplifies the process of returning to the trial license if needed.
