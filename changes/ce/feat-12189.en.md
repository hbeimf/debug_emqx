Enhanced JWT ACL Claim Format.

The JWT ACL claim has been upgraded to support a more versatile format.
It now accepts an array structure, which resembles the file-based ACL rules.

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "permission": "allow",
    "action": "pub",
    "topic": "${username}/#",
    "qos": [0,1],
    "retain": true
  },
  {
    "permission": "allow",
    "action": "sub",
    "topic": "eq ${username}/#",
    "qos": [0,1]
  },
  {
    "permission": "deny",
    "action": "all",
    "topics": ["#"]
  }
]
```

In this new format, when no matching rule is found, the action is not automatically denied.
This allows the authorization process to proceed to other configured authorization sources.
If no match is found throughout the chain, the final decision defers to the default permission set in `authorization.no_match`.
