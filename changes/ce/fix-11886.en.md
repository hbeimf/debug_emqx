Fixed backward plugin compatibility.

Currently, EMQX validates hookpoint names, so invalid hookspoints cannot be used for registering hooks. However, older versions of plugin templates used some misspelled hookpoints, and so could the real plugins. We allow the old hookpoints to be used for registering hooks, but issue a warning that they are deprecated. As before, these hooks are never called.
