Fix topic-filter overlapping handling in shared subscription.
In the previous implementation, the storage method for subscription options did not provide adequate support for shared subscriptions. This resulted in message routing failures and leakage of routing tables between nodes during the "subscribe-unsubscribe" process with specific order and topics.

## Breaking changes
* Hook callback `session.subscribed` and `client.subscribe` will now receive shared subscription in its full representation, e.g. `$share/group1/topic1/#`, and the `share` property is deleted from `subopts`.
* Hook callback `session.unsubscribed` and `client.unsubscribe` will now receive shared subscription in its full representation, e.g. `$share/group1/topic1/#` instead of just `topic1/#`.
* ExHook Proto changed. The `share` field in message `SubOpts` was deprecated.
  ExHook Server will now receive shared subscription in its full representation, e.g. `$share/group1/topic1/#`, and the `share` property is deleted from message `SubOpts`.
* `session.subscribed` and `session.unsubscribed` rule-engine events will have shared subscriptions in their full representation for `topic`, e.g. `$share/group1/topic1/#` instead of just `topic1/#`.
