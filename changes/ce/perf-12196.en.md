Improve network efficiency during routes cleanup.

Previously, when a node node was down, a delete operation for every route to that node must have been exchanged between all other live nodes.
After this change, only one 'match and delete' operation is exchanged between all live nodes, meaning that much fewer packets are to be sent over inter-cluster network.
This optimization must be especially helpful for geo-distributed EMQX deployments, when network latency can be significantly high.
