Updated `gen_rpc` library to version 3.3.1. The new version includes
several performance improvements:

- Avoid allocating extra memory for the packets before they are sent
  to the wire in some cases

- Bypass network for the local calls

- Avoid senstive data leaking in debug logs [#12202](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12202)
